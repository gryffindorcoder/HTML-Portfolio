        <h3>The Rookie</h3>
            <p>I love The Rookie because its about baseball.<br> Jimmy Morris is a High School coach that challenges his players to step it up. <br> In return he will try out for the majors. <br> He gets a surprise when he challenges his players.</p>

        <h3>The Natural</h3>
            <p>I love the movie The Natural because it is about a baseball player that defies the odds. <br> Roy Hobbs plays in the majors and people want him to take a dive. <br> He has to make the sacrifice to be able to play the game of baseball for cheaters or give it up.</p>
